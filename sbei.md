# Small Business Equity Initiative (SBEI)

## Concept

We are looking for motivated individuals and teams near the beginning of their career interested in starting a business.  Our aim is to not only to provide seed capital to start the businesses, but to become true partners with the end goal of creating financial independence for the entrepreneur, growth in the surrounding employment market, and charitable benefits to the community which we serve.


## Entrepreneur Profile

While the educational background of the entrepreneur is certainly of interest, it is not our primary consideration.  We are far, far more interested in your demonstrable work-ethic and previous community and charitable activities.  In short, if you are a good person and can't help but work your ass off--we'd like to chat.

## Family Focused

Our entreprenuers create an environment of stability, trust, and love in their homes.  It's a prerequisite for success in our businesses and the definition of success in our lives.  All of our investment partners are faithful Christians and it is the lens through which we advise on balancing the demands of work and family.  Our partnership would extend towards ensuring a strong business and family life are always present.

    
## Business Profile

We are most interested in B2B, commercial, or industrial service type businesses.  Businesses that serve the general public or residential customers are still interesting to us if they have a technical aspect to their offering.  We are generally not interested in helping start things like a coffee shop, restaurant, or retail businesses.  Think more along the lines of a lawn care business, roofing, machinery services, or a novel offering of X to solve problem Y in the aforementioned sectors.  If what you have in mind isn't listed here, refer back to the [Entrepreneur Profile](#entrepreneur-profile), which contains the most important qualifications.



    
## Example Investment Structure
    

#### <ins>Jimmy's Widget Service</ins>
* SBEI Investment:  $75,000
    * Equipment:  $25,000
    * Working Capital:  $50,000
* Initial Ownership Split:  49% Entrepreneur  / 51% SBEI
* Ownership Transfer
    * IF:  $300,000 in Net Profit achieved.
    * IF:  All SBEI investment paid back through distributions.
    * THEN:  Additional 26% of Business sold to Entrepreneur for $1.00.
    * Remaining Business available to Entrepreneur at fair-market valuations.

    Here's a model of what this could look like over time:

   |          | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
    |:----|    :----:|  :----: | :----:|  :----:|  :----:|
    |Sales|$260,000| $390,000 | $580,000 | $870,000 | $1,300,000 |
    |Expenses|$242,000|$313,000|$420,000|$580,000|$820,000|
    |Profit|$18,000|$77,000|$160,000|$290,000|$480,000|

    By this model the entrepreneur could have easily returned all of the original SBEI investment and could purchase a majority stake in the business at the conclusion of Year 5 for $1.00.  This is of course an overly simplified and overly generalized model, but remains a great example of what can be done together.



    
## Why?
    

#### Two Reasons  
1. We genuinely believe that Good People + Hard Work + Support = Great Things.
2. This is exactly the type of opportunity we wish would have been available to us at the onset of our careers.



    
## FAQ
    

#### <ins>Why does SBEI own a majority of the business?
Only in the beginning, and we *really* don't want it to stay that way.  We want our entrepreneurs to own and control the businesses they build.  We start the business this way so that we can make quick on going decisions on things like corporate structure, liability policies, employment strategies, and legal matters.  The hope is that our experience and infrastructure will free our entrepreneurs up to focus on growing and marketing the business.  Once things are truly humming along, then we sell our controlling interest back to the entrepreneur for $1.00...as in one buck.

#### <ins>Can I buy out 100% of my business?
Sure.  Once the business has hit the mutually agreed upon net profit target and our initial investment has been paid back + $1.00, the business can be purchased at a fair-market valuation as determined by a 3rd-party appraiser. 

#### <ins>What does SBEI actually do after the investment?
Operationally: &nbsp; Nothing.  &nbsp;That's up to you.

While we remain the majority owners we will assist with setting up the company itself, establishing systems and software, yearly tax compliance, and other bureaucratic matters.  We will also hold strategy sessions and trainings specific to the entrepreneur.  The goal is to launch the entrepreneur from someone with a dream into a fully competent business executive.

#### <ins> Is SBEI still a resource after I'm the majority owner?
Absolutely--but only if you want us around.  We aim to prove ourselves as so valuable through the ramp up years, that you want us to stay on as an investment partner.

#### <ins>Will I earn a salary?
Yes, in fact--we'll require it.  Stability with your personal finances is a prerequisite to being able to concentrate on your business.

#### <ins>What about other health and other benefits?
At a minimum you'll have health insurance through the business.  Stability with your personal health is a prerequisite to be able to concentrate on the business.  Other benefits and details are mutually agreed upon and based on individual/family circumstances.
